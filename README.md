# Groundhog Day

> Okay, campers, rise and shine...

A nice, little loop for rails console to keep your destructive changes in a transaction.

Use it like this:

1. In a console, type <code>Groundhog.day</code> to start the loop.
2. Go nuts! There are _literally_ no consequences to your actions.
3. Press ^D to end it all wake up in your comfy bed.
4. Quickly press ^D ^C to get out of Punxsutawney and back to your normal life.
