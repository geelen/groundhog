# Groundhog Day

> Okay, campers, rise and shine...

A nice, little loop for rails console to keep your destructive changes in a transaction.

Or add <code>gem 'groundhog'</code> to your Gemfile.

### Use it

1. In a console, type <code>Groundhog.day</code> to start the loop.
2. Go nuts! There are _literally_ no consequences to your actions.
3. Press <code>^D</code> to end it all and wake up in your comfy bed.
4. Quickly press <code>^D ^C</code> to get out of Punxsutawney and back to your normal life.
